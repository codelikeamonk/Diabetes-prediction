# Diabetes Prediction



## Introduction
 Develop a classification system to detect whether the patient has diabetes or not using Decision tree, Naive Bayes, SVM calculations on Kaggle.


## Environment
Language: Python-3


## Theory
Bayes Theorem provides a way that we can calculate the probability of a hypothesis given our prior knowledge.

Bayesâ€™ Theorem is stated as:

                            P(h|d) = (P(d|h) * P(h)) / P(d)


Where,
P(h|d) is the probability of hypothesis h given the data d. This is called the posterior probability.

P(d|h) is the probability of data d given that the hypothesis h was true.

P(h) is the probability of hypothesis h being true (regardless of the data). This is called the prior probability of h.

P(d) is the probability of the data (regardless of the hypothesis).
## Result

Accuracy is:  0.7619047619047619
